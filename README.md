# Automatic-manual-transmission
Using this software you can make your manual transmission cars clutch operate automatically for comfortable and easy driving.
Automatic transmission cars have higher price than manual transmission cars. there are advantages and disadvantages of both systems,
but can you get both in a car and switch between two types ?
why not.. i have built one. dont forget to check youtube video of working demo.

Motivation behind creating this project :
Driving a manual transmission car in city traffic is exhausting for me because to constant need to operate clutch. i wish i had an automatic transmision car. but its not feasible to replace car only for this reason so i found a way to automate cluch operartions. Also my family members are finding it very easy to drive the car with this installed.

do some research if you have any concerns about features included in this project
before trying it! YOU are choosing to make these modifications, and if
you point the finger at me for messing up your car, I will laugh at you.
